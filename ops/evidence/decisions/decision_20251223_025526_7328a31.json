  "decision": "Implement ADR governance with canonical JSON receipts and mandatory cross-link validation. Each ADR must reference exactly one decision receipt, and each receipt must be referenced by an ADR.",
  "consequences": "All architecture decisions have cryptographic integrity proofs. CI enforces cross-link policy preventing orphan receipts or undocumented decisions.",
