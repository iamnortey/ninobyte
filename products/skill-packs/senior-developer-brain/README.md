## Why This Moved

As of v0.1.1, Ninobyte aligns with the **official Anthropic Skills convention**:
- Skills live in a root-level `skills/` directory
- SKILL.md uses official YAML frontmatter format
- Skills are distributed via Claude Code plugins

See [VALIDATION_LOG.md](../../../docs/canonical/VALIDATION_LOG.md) entries VL-20251219-003/004/005 for official source validation.
