# Repo-Root Pytest Configuration (Monorepo Strategy)
# =============================================================================
#
# TEST STRATEGY:
#   - Repo-root pytest runs "core suite" (92 tests): MCP servers + plugins
#   - Product-specific test suites (e.g., NetOpsPack 112 tests) are run via
#     their own pytest configurations and enforced via scripts/ci/validate_*.py
#
# WHY NOT INCLUDE ALL PRODUCTS?
#   - Products like NetOpsPack require PYTHONPATH setup for imports
#   - Running from repo root without setup causes collection errors
#   - The validator-based approach ensures tests run with correct environment
#
# TO RUN ALL TESTS:
#   python3 scripts/ci/validate_artifacts.py  # Runs all validators including pytest gates
#
# TOTAL TEST COVERAGE:
#   - Repo-root: 92 tests (mcp-servers, plugins)
#   - NetOpsPack: 112 tests (via validate_netopspack.py)
#   - Combined: 204 tests
#
